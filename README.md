# Predicting Heart Disease Using Tree-Based Machine Learning Models
This repository contains the work I did for a group project during my Master's degree. We compared various ensemble decision-tree-based methods to predict heart disease using R and Weka.

## Data
The `Data` subdirectory contains the original data files, the cleaned data files, and the cleaned data files split into training and test sets. The cleaned datsets and training/test sets are available in \*.csv format and the Weka format (\*.arff). Since we compared models built in both R and Weka, we created the training/test sets so that the same data are used.
